# COMP-390-Tutorial---Image-Classifcation-with-CNN
Welcome to the project repo for the COMP 390 Tutorial for making an example Image Classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

There are some pointers to know about wanting to replicate this project.

1. This project is meant to be run in Google Colab

This project is coded in Python, but running the constructed CNN will require GPU power. It is **advised** you do not try to code along in an IDE on your local machine. This is because your GPU will not be natively used when running the neural networks, and this requires a complex setup(e.g installing CUDA). If you attempt to run the networks without the proper configuration or knowledge of making the GPU run them, you will notice that it will take a while for neural nets to train and test. This is why Google Colab is the prefered environment to code in because you can run the code using a GPU a lot simpler. Also, the cell structure to type in the code makes it simpler to only run the code that is necessary.
