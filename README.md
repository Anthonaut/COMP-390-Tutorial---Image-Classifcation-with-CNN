# COMP-390-Tutorial---Image-Classifcation-with-CNN
Welcome to the project repo for the COMP 390 Tutorial for making an example Image Classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

There are some pointers to know about wanting to replicate this project.

1. This project is meant to be run in Google Colab

This project is coded in Python, but running the constructed CNN will require GPU power. It is **advised** you do not try to code along in an IDE on your local machine. This is because your GPU will not be natively used when running the neural networks, and this requires a complex setup(e.g installing CUDA). If you attempt to run the networks without the proper configuration or knowledge of making the GPU run them, you will notice that it will take a while for neural nets to train and test. This is why Google Colab is the prefered environment to code in because you can run the code using a GPU a lot simpler. Also, the cell structure to type in the code makes it simpler to only run the code that is necessary.

2. The YouTube tutorial to follow along - [Real-World Python Neural Nets Tutorial (Image Classification w/ CNN) | Tensorflow & Keras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44U8jJxaNp8&t=680s).

The link given above is the tutorial to follow along. You'll find it helpful to code along the same way the instructor does (e.g syntax, variable names), which makes spotting mistakes easier. There is also no requirement to view any of the instructor's other videos to follow along. 

For reference, there is the code file that shows the output of each of the cell's code block executed and another file without any output shown. This is to help in seeing just tbe code or seeing what the expected output should be in running the code blocks on your own Google Colab.
